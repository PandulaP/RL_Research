# PbPI Algorithm

This folder contains all the necessary files to run both versions, i.e., modified and original versions of the Preference-based Policy Iteration algorithm.

- `algo_core`: includes the main scripts required to run the PbPI algorithm
- `algo_inputs` : includes the **initial state sets** used to run the PbPI algorithm (note: states are generated by generating a representative sample of the underlying state space: please refer to the 'initial_state_analysis' section for more information).
- `algo_outputs` : inludes the outputs generated while running the PbPI algorithm, i.e., evaluation plots and the LabelRanker models.
- `custom_cartpole` : includes the `custom-cartpole` environment used to run the PbPI algorithm.
