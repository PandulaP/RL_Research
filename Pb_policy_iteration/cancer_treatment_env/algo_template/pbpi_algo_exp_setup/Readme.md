#### PbPI Algorithm Implementation on the Inverted-Pendulum Environment.

This folder contains the necessary files to run the PbPI algorithm on the Inverted-Pendulum aka Cart-Pole environment.

- The `experiments` folder contains the scripts to run experiments with different parameter configurations.
- The `pbpi` folder contains the core algorithm files, and the corresponding `cart-pole` environment.
- The `evaluation_results.ipynb` file can be used to generate evaluation plots based on the experiment results.
